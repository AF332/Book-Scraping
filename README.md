# Web Scraping Project: Books to Scrape

## Project Overview
This project involves web scraping the "Books to Scrape" website to extract detailed information about books listed on the site. The scraped data includes details such as book names, prices, availability, and descriptions. The extracted information is saved into a structured **CSV file** for easy analysis and accessibility.

This project demonstrates proficiency in web scraping techniques using **Python** and libraries like **BeautifulSoup**, **Requests**, and **Pandas**.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Data Extraction**: Scrapes book details such as:
  - Book Name
  - Price
  - Availability
  - Universal Product Code (UPC)
  - Tax
  - Number of Reviews
  - Description
- **Category-wise Scraping**: Retrieves data across all book categories listed on the website.
- **Pagination Handling**: Automatically navigates through multiple pages within each category.
- **Data Storage**: Stores the extracted data into a **CSV file** for further use and analysis.

## Installation and Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-scraping-books.git
   cd web-scraping-books
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script to scrape the website:
   ```bash
   python Book_Scraping.py
   ```

4. **Output**:
   The script will generate a file named `book_data.csv` containing the scraped data.

## Output Structure
The `book_data.csv` file contains the following columns:
- **Book Name**: Title of the book.
- **Book Link**: URL of the book's details page.
- **Category**: Category to which the book belongs.
